(a) The step in a reaction mechanism that determines the rate of reaction
rate-determining step


(b) A reaction step that involves two molecules
bimolecular


(c) The rate of change of concentration of a reactive species, in a sequence of reactions is approximately zero
steady state approximation


(d) A highly unstable species
 reactive intermediate
